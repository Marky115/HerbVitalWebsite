# General Information
This project was done in pairs. Our final project is a health/wellness website about herbs where it provides detailed information about each herb including its benefits, possible side effects, and recommended usage. For registered members, the site will allow them to personalize their experience by saving favorites, customizing their homepage and interacting with the community. The goal is to inform users, rather than to sell products.
